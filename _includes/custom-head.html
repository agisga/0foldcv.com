  MathJax integration and configuration

  For proper syntax for block or span-level mathematics in Kramdown see:
  https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks
  which essentially tells to always use $$...$$ for block as well as inline math;
  if $$...$$ is used as delimiter then the syntax is identical to standard LaTeX
  (with the only exception that | may need to be replaced with \vert);
  if standard MathJax delimenters \(...\) or \[...\] are used then lots of
  things need to be escaped with \ in different ways (for example,
  \_ becomes _ but \\ is becomes <br>).
