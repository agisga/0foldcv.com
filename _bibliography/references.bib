  abstract = "A new reproducibility index is developed and studied. This index
              is the correlation between the two readings that fall on the 45
              degree line through the origin. It is simple to use and possesses
              desirable properties. The statistical properties of this estimate
              can be satisfactorily evaluated using an inverse hyperbolic
              tangent transformation. A Monte Carlo experiment with 5,000 runs
              was performed to confirm the estimate's validity. An application
              using actual data is given.",
