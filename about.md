My name is Alexej Gossmann.
I'm professionally interested in machine learning :smiling_imp:, statistics :innocent:, AI :unamused:, mathematics :neckbeard:, software development in those areas, medical applications of the above.
I keep a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a> to practice writing fast.

_0-fold Cross-Validation_ is the name of this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a>.
All opinions are mine, obviously.
