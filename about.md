This is a blog about machine learning, statistics, data analysis, artificial intelligence, mathematics, computation, and related topics.
Writing helps me in the process of learning new concepts, as well as reviewing/re-learning.

:elephant: Also feel free read my [math-stats-ML-micro-posts at @0foldcv@mathstodon.xyz](https://mathstodon.xyz/@0foldcv), where I regularly post (or toot) random math/stats/ML things that I find noteworthy. [Mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/about) toots are like tweets but with $$\LaTeX$$ rendering, and 500 character limit; [join Mastodon!](https://joinmastodon.org/). Don't expect any great revelations though. I hope that some :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face: may find these posts mildly interesting.

I have another blog / personal website with a different focus at <https://www.alexejgossmann.com/>.
