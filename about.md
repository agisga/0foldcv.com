This is the homepage of Alexej Gossmann.
I'm professionally interested in machine learning :smiling_imp:, statistics :innocent:, AI :unamused:, mathematics :neckbeard:, software development in those areas, medical applications of the above.

I keep a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a> to practice writing fast.
Blog posts from before 2019 were previously available under `www.alexejgossmann.com`. Now under a new URL :astonished:, and with a simpler design which is easier to maintain.

All opinions are mine; obviously.
