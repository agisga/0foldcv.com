This is my new blog where I (intend to) write about machine learning, statistics, data analysis, artificial intelligence, mathematics, computation, and related topics.
Writing helps me in the process of learning new concepts, as well as reviewing/re-learning.

[:elephant::elephant::elephant: Also read my math-stats-ML-micro-posts at @0foldcv@mathstodon.xyz :wave::wave::wave:](https://mathstodon.xyz/@0foldcv)
Under the name 0-fold cross-validation I also post a daily toot (or toots) of random math/stats/ML things that I find noteworthy through [Mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/about) at [@0foldcv@mathstodon.xyz](https://mathstodon.xyz/@0foldcv) (Mathstodon toots are like tweets but with $$\LaTeX$$ rendering, and 500 character limit; [join Mastodon!](https://joinmastodon.org/)). Don't expect any great revelations. I hope that some :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face: may find these posts mildly interesting.

I have another blog / personal website with a different focus at <https://www.alexejgossmann.com/>.
