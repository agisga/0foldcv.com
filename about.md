Hi, my name is Alexej Gossmann.
I'm professionally interested in machine learning :smiling_imp:, statistics :innocent:, AI :unamused:, mathematics :neckbeard:, software development in those areas, medical applications of the above.
I keep a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a> to practice writing fast.

**_0-fold Cross-Validation_** is the name of this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">blog</a>.
All opinions are mine, obviously.

**2021 Update:** Unfortunately, I have been updating this blog very infrequently (less than once a year) after finishing my PhD studies in 2018. Despite the novel typing technique (demonstrated below), having kids and a real job has reduced my blog post output very substantially. But I will do my best to post occasionally as I still have many ideas for new articles on this blog.
